              <p><i>
TUX or Teaching UX, is an application that supports Appian developers through the journey of implementing a high-standard user experience. 
              </i></p>
              
               <h5>The Problem</h5>
              <p>
                Originally TUX was meant to solely focus in UX Reviews. Early 2022, I was assigned to work in a team of advisors to external clients. It was common understanding that UX reviews would go through me which quickly became overwhelming. I ended catering for client from all of myu teams and sister teams from different regions in EMEA. It was not viable for me to be th eonly ressource available to troubleshoot bad UX, so I decided to create a fremework to transfer the knowledge.
</p><p>
                Whilst writing and building out the framework’s back bone, I realised that most of the structural design problems I had witnessed in clients are:
  <ol>
  <li>Repetitive across different clients</li>
  <li>Stem from a lack of planning</li>
  <li>Blamed on a lack of time</li>
</ol>
            
Meaning that if I wanted to implement a true solution to improve UX on Appian, I would have to address each of those problems.



              </p>

<h5>The Solution</h5>
              <p>
TUX is, simply put, the story of how this framework became an app. The primary aim of TUX is to support Appian developer throughout they journey in design their own user experience. 
              </p>

               <p>
                First of, it is important to start your design on the right foot by intentionally planning and sticking to this plan. Through TUX, the user can create their own starter packs to create a live ressources of their core UX which they can share and collaborate on. TUX not only holds each team’s data but supplies additional  tools and ressources to guide them through building a full starter pack. 
                 </p>

                  <p>
                    TUX will also accompany the developer through reviewing their designs later in the implementation. Through the UX Check-ins, anyone can, through a set of questions, gear where are the pain points in their designs. The user’s answer will help TUX define which set of solution and ressources would be most helpful to the user.  
                 </p>

                  <p>
                    Last but not least, the most popular feature on TUX is its pattern gallery. To quickly grab functional pieces of code (that you can test live!), it is easy to navigate to the gallery, browse through the community-sourced patterns and pick the one you like. The gallery is not only a virtual shop of patterns, but also live hub for users to communicate through comments, likes, favorites as well as help help each other through the patterns they share. 
                 </p>
                                   <p>
Today, TUX is live and available to all internal Appian employees. 1 months after its full release, the app has more than 200+ unique users and 150+ patterns. TUX is now a rich platform that will grow alongside its florishing community.

              </blockquote>

<h5>My Responsabilities</h5>
              <p>
  
My role started as the creator of the novel UX framework and only developer of the app that will embody it. As the project grew, my duties shifted towards more high-level tasks. I was responsable of the end-to-end delivery of TUX as well as all the communications surrounding its launches and demos. I lead a daily stand-up to discuss the technical delivery with the delivery team and held refinement sessions to detail the requirements and their implementation. I also help weekly calls with manager to strategies the communication, timeline and direction of TUX. 
              </p>

<h5>Challenges </h5>
<p>
  
TUX was a fully self-motivated project, which means that, no official ressources can be allocated to it which means two things: first, that I would have to find “volonteers” and second, that I would have to jungle a client engagement at the same time. A big challenge was to keep the team staffed whilst maintaining a steady development pace and insuring smooth knowledge transfer throughout a full year. 
I found 3 things were most useful in managing this challenge:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>It is important to maintain good visibility of tasks at hand, keep an organised set of core resources and try to preempt timeline lags. 
</li>
  <li>TUX was not released in one go, each feature was progressively rolled out. This iatypical way of releasing an app made time boxing development periods easier and enabled a more focused approach to the communication around it. From a user’s perspective, this pace built up an ongoing hyper whilst easing the introduction of newer features, building up to a comprehensive but intelligible product. 
</li>
  <li>On the long run, It is worth investing in getting people on board with a vision rather than trying to micro-manage them.
</li>
</ol>

                Unfortunately, I cannot publicly share screenshots, but I'm happy to provide them upon request.
